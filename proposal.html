            <h1>PokerWiki - Project Proposal</h1>
            <p>By Mateos Norian</p>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                I'd like to create a website that lists all professional poker players, and scrapes data about them (ie.
                total live winnings, where they went to school, things of that nature). Basically, Wikipedia for poker
                players.
            </p>

        <section class='objective'>
            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>
                Most of the poker wikis out there don't include much about the poker player's personal lives .. such as
                school, hometown, and I think that's the most interesting stuff about a player because it gives you some
                insight into their background.

                So, my objective would be to create a more personal poker wiki.

            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>
                I think the answer to this question is fairly obvious, but my target audience would be enthusiastic
                poker players.. people who like to
            <ul>
                <li>Read about poker</li>
                <li>Play consistently</li>
                <li>Subscribe to poker training sites</li>
                <li>Constantly looking to improve their game</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class='page-content'>
            <h3>Page content</h3>
            <p>
                Each wiki page would contain
            <ul>
                <li>Hometown</li>
                <li>Favorite hand</li>
                <li>Total live winnings</li>
                <li>Links to scraped youtube videos of them playing</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
